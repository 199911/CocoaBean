CocoaBean is a javaScript application framework. An application can be generated by 'cocoabean new' command. A cocoa bean application can be generated into 'html app', 'ios app' and 'os x app' with one command. Android and windows will be supported in the future.

Inside a cocoa bean application, use 'cocoabean test' to unit test your code. Use 'cocoabean preview' to lanuch web browser or simulator depends on options you provided and application configuration. Use 'cocoabean open' to open the application in your favorite test editor or IDE. Use 'cocoabean dist' to generate the application executable or web page.

You may customize the behavior through 'Beanfile' and '~/.cocoabeanrc'.
